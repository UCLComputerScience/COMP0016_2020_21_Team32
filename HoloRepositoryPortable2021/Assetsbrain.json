API with same notation used as http
not local
Idea is isolate the kind of function
Got a model in the NHS cloud
Service that, when called, gives back binary of the model
Annotations are metadata
Different API functions
edit, delete, create metadata
one http entry that we send our Json that we generate in our application
Try firebase - make mockup of service
Load model
create, edit
annotation is a dictionary:
	Different keys
	embed json
